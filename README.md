cov-invent
==========
This is a (currently simple) GUI-based set of inventory management tools, originally designed, implemented and deployed
in the ev3/Covidien Irvine Warehouse.
The main entry point in main.py, which then feeds into all other modules in the package. The design and feature
additions are driven by users of the system in Irvine, so any oddities may be do to strangeness there.
